I am a recent **Master's graduate** from The Ohio State University. In my time there, I worked on embedded systems, automated driving systems, fault diagnosis, statistical learning, and advanced robotics. My research interests lie in the areas of probabilistic modelling, control engineering, motion planning, & efficient computational techniques for mobile robotics. I am currently on the job market for full time automotive & robotics software positions starting fall of 2025.

I am currently working on:
- State estimation and motion planning in automated vehicles using variational state-space Gaussian processes.
- Robustness performance testing of model-based controller in low-traction road conditions using high fidelity 14 d-o-f electric vehicle model.
