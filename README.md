# Personal website

Thoughts on science & engineering, planning & design, robotics & learning, systems engineering, etc. I am on the job market for full time automotive & robotics industry positions starting fall of 2025. Site is currently under development.

This repository contains all of the source code pulled from the minimal-mistakes Jekyll theme used to build the website. Template can be found [**here**](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate)
